    "In this pre-class assignment we are going to explore your project ideas for class.  The ideas are pulled from the project brainstorming you did previously. The instructional staff did their best to interpret the concept of your ideas based on what you submitted to the previous pre-class survey. In some cases we had to try to put vagues thoughts into concrete categories and we may have misconstrued the original intent -- sorry if your idea was mangled!\n",

    "    * Is the project something you are interested in?\n",
    "    * How hard will the project be for a group to complete? \n",
    "    * Can you find any python libraries or datasets that would help with the project?\n",
    "    * Is this just a toy project or is the project scientifically motivated. I.e. what broad scientific questions would this project be able to answer?\n",
