Spend about 10-15 minutes outlining the code, psuedo-coding, or writing **stub functions**.\n",

Stub functions are when we go a step beyond outlining, describing, or writing pseudo and actually start to flesh out the structure that we want our code to have. We might quickly mock up a new Python class by creating the initial class and dropping in the functions we event want to have, but don't actually go through the process of implement the code we have planned.

I can use `pass` so that the code will \"run\" and not throw any syntax errors, but it won't actually do anything. I can then start working on my code one method at a time and build my class without forgetting about any of my plans. There's even folks [talking about the utility of stub functions on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7620382/stubbing-out-functions-or-classes)\n",
