    "## 1. Getting more practice with Generative AI and being intentional about how you use and cite it\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've done previously, we're going to spend a bit of time thinking about how we might use generative AI as a tool to assist and accelerate our computational work. There are many ways that generative AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/[) and [Claude](https://claude.ai/) can assist you when you run into expected struggles in your computational work and it can be really good at some things, while struggling with others. Of course, it is also important that we are transparent about how and went we use these tools and that we cite them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in, let's look at how one of these tools defines itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following text is generated from:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5. Accessed on Sept 15, 2023 from https://chat.openai.com/.  Prompt chain:{'What is GPT-3'} \n",
    "\n",
    "> GPT-3, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, is a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI. It's the third iteration in the GPT series of models and is known for its remarkable ability to understand and generate human-like text. Here are some key characteristics and features of GPT-3:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Scale:** GPT-3 is one of the largest language models, containing 175 billion parameters. The large scale of the model contributes to its impressive language understanding and generation capabilities.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. **Pre-training:** Like its predecessors, GPT-3 is pre-trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet. During pre-training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence, gaining a deep understanding of grammar, context, and semantics.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3. **Fine-tuning:** GPT-3 can be fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains. This means it can be adapted for a wide range of NLP tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, question-answering, and more.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 4. **Human-like text generation:** GPT-3 is known for its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. It can answer questions, write essays, create conversational agents, and perform various language-related tasks.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 5. **Zero-shot and few-shot learning:** GPT-3 can perform tasks with minimal examples or instructions, making it highly versatile. It can understand and execute tasks even when provided with very limited context.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 6. **Ethical considerations:** GPT-3 has sparked discussions about its potential for misuse, including generating misleading information, disinformation, or deepfakes. OpenAI has implemented ethical guidelines and usage policies to address these concerns.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> GPT-3 has been widely used in a variety of applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to content generation, language translation, and more. It has the potential to revolutionize the field of natural language processing and human-computer interaction.\n"

    "### 1.1 Citing Generative AI in your code and work\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we experiment with this tools again, we want to reiterate our expectations for how you should use and cite these tools.  We've talked about this before, but it's worth repeating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Citing sources in your work is necessary for several important reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Giving Credit:** When you use someone else's ideas, research, or words in your work, it's essential to give proper credit to the original source. Citing acknowledges the intellectual property of others and shows respect for their contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoiding Plagiarism:** Failure to cite sources can lead to plagiarism, which is a serious academic and ethical violation. Plagiarism occurs when you present someone else's work as your own. Proper citations help you avoid this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Providing Evidence and Authority:** Citing reputable sources adds credibility and authority to your work. It demonstrates that your ideas are supported by existing research or expert opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Allowing Verification:** Readers should be able to verify the claims and evidence you present in your work. By citing your sources, you allow others to find and review the same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Showing Your Research Process:** Proper citations demonstrate that you've done your research and have considered various perspectives and sources. It adds depth and reliability to your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Avoiding Legal Issues:** In some cases, failing to cite sources can lead to legal issues, especially if you use copyrighted material without permission.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Prompts**: Provide the prompts or a summary of the prompts that generated the content (for example: `Prompt chain:{'how many licks does it take to get to the middle of a tootsie roll; please shorten that; can you write it in limerick form}`)\n",
