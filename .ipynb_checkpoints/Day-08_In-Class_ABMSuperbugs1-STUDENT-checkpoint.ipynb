    "1. Assume that bacteria on the board do not move. \n",
    "1. Assume each bacteria has a genome sequence of three genes of continuous number (e.g. 0 to 1) that provide immunity to the antibiotics. Each gene will correspond to one of the antibiotic elements deposited on the petri dish\n",
    "1. Assume that at each iteration of the simulation each bacteria can randomly copy itself once to a random neighboring empty cell (up, down, left, or right). \n",
    "1. Assume that during the copy there is a chance of mutating each gene (randomly selecting a new value between zero and one) by some mutation rate (e.g. 20%). \n",
