    "\n",
    "During the semester, you must have explored a couple of the freely available generative AI tools. In this pre-class assignment, we're going to revisit those tools and have you practice using them. The hope is that this might give you some ideas for how you might be able to use them in your future coding endeavors and as you work with your group on your final projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two tools we explored previously are [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/[) and [Claude](https://claude.ai/). For the prompts that follow, use whichever one of these your prefer (or, if you know of another one, you can use that). If you want to try both, feel free to do so!\n",

    "\n",
    "**Do this**: Ask whichever generative AI tool you chose to explain the code to you. You can do this by copying and pasting the code into the tool and then asking it to explain it to you. If you get stuck, try asking it to explain a specific part of the code. For example, you could ask it to explain the line `y = np.dot(X, coefs) > 0`.\n",

    "Summarize what you learned from the generative AI tool in the markdown cell below. If you used both tools, you can summarize what you learned from each one and comment on any difference in their performance."
